What makes a good commit?
-------------------------

Commit often and once you've made a small change.
Try to avoid large commits with lots of changes.
Small commits make it much easier to walk the
commits and follow what has been changed.
It also makes it easier to revert changes.

You will want to include the ticket number in the
commit to link the commit to the ticket, this
makes it easier to trace which commit refers to
which change.
