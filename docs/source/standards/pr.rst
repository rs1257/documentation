PRs
=====

What to look for in a pull request?
------------------------------------
Small and frequent PRs are best as they are easier
to review. And the reviews are better.
For longer PRs you get fatigue. Smaller PRs can
also introduce other issues, you may need to
introduce feature flags if the code is not
fully completed or ready to be turned on.

Key areas to focus on:

- Security
- Complexity
- Doing to much
